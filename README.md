# BookKeeper
RTS base game on Unity

Book Keeper is a simple RTS "like". You play a wizard controlling an army of minions protecting his manor. You need to break the house of any other wizard to win the game. To do this, you can use you minions to fight other enemy minions and IA tribes. Moreover, you can resuscitate enemy minions when the entire army is dead. You can hide in your manor to regenerate your health and minion health, your manor is shooting arrows. When a minion died 3 times, he can't be resuscitate.
In the future, you will have spells to cast on your opponent and youself, and the wizard will respawn at home when dead.
Obviously the game can only work online.

You can find on the repository an export of the game and the unity project.
Feel free to check both of us.

All codes, models and animation are homemade <3
